Neryn
Mission 6 problems:
on Discord: @Ithaka said he will report the issues, if find any
reported by @DDDDestroyer on Discord:
you have to do some hardcore cheesing to win it because the AI begins attacking at like 15 or 20 minutes?
i beat it by making sure my knight is always fed, setting up a killzone at the 1-2 tile wide path through the hills (western edge of the allied village) and continuously baiting out the enemy garrison unit by unit with one crossbowman
and speeding construction to get out a few extra melee units around 45 minutes
so that i could hold off the attacks from the second village which were going for the coal supply


@Ithaka report:
@Rey Played on the last version of the beta, not r5503, i'll try later
Neryn (1&2) : ok
Neryn (3) : No fish in water, frustrating x)
Neryn (4) : ok
Neryn (5) : seems ok, maybe the map is too big for the surface used but it don't disturb the game.
Neryn (6) : At start (3min), you got attacked and you have barbarians as ally defending you on west and east. After surviving to the attack, the west ally troups sometimes goes defend their base ( which is logic, cause his own base is under attack ) Sometime he rush directly into the enemy base, dunno know why. i think he is looking for the nearest enemy. After that, you got attacked at 15min and you have to defend with very few troops that make it very hard especially if you failed the start. And another attack at 20 mins and 30mins, i lost here ^^
There are also scripts error for you ally when building, when it happens he does't build anymore.
i stop here for today, i think i'll use cheat to skip this one. i'll retry once or twice tommorow.
